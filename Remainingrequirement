I'm writing about the part which I missed due to time. Requirement was user were able to edit the record on the component.

I know I was not able to complete that part due to time limit and I wanted to explain my plan for the same.

make inputfield for all and add save on the component.
save the recordid and related fields in component attribute.
when controller finds that save button click for the particular record, with the help of saved recordid, 
set params (saved accountid, name, annual revenue, OwnerName, Website & Phone) and it will pass to method to update the record.
public class (Account a,annualrevenue, OwnerName, Website, Phone)
a.annualrevenue = annualrevenue;
a.phone = phone;
a.Owner.Name = OwnerName;
a.Website = Website;
a.Phone = Phone;
update a;

This was going on my mind but I was not able to fulfilled this due to time limits.

Thank you,
